== Introduction

IchiFund is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing finance*. More importantly, IchiFund is
*optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a
Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, IchiFund can get your finance management tasks done faster than
traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `ichifund.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your IchiFund.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window. +
Here are some example commands you can try in the transaction tab:

* **`addtx`**`de/Lunch a/12.30` : adds an expenditure item for "Lunch" to IchiFund.
* **`filtertx`**`m/10 y/2019 c/!all ty/exp` : finds all expenditure items from October 2019.
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Navigation>> for details on how to navigate through the application.
.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

[[Navigation]]
== Navigation
IchiFund has five features: Transactions, Repeaters, Budgets, Loans and Analytics.
Each feature is allocated to its own tab, and the commands for each feature only work when you are
using the tab associated to the feature.

When you enter a command that is not used by the feature, the following message is shown:

image::InapplicableCommand.png[]

In this case, `expenditure`, a command for the "Analytics", is not recognised as the application is currently
is the "Transactions" tab.

=== Switching tabs

We offer three modes for you to switch tabs:

. Clicking on the tab
. Using a shortcut key
. Entering a global command

The global commands and shortcut keys are summarized in the table below:

|==============================
| Feature | Command | Shortcut Key

| Transactions | `tx` | `Ctrl + 1`
| Repeaters | `rep` | `Ctrl + 2`
| Budgets | `budget` | `Ctrl + 3`
| Loans | `loan` | `Ctrl + 4`
| Analytics | `analytics` | `Ctrl + 5`
|==============================

To use the global command, simply enter the command as you would for any other
command, and the application automatically switches to the appropriate tab.
These commands are recognised regardless of which tab you are currently using.

=== Transactions

Do you ever feel overwhelmed by the ever-growing number of transactions you have to keep track of?
With our transactions feature, you can organise your transactions in a fuss-free manner!

In the transactions tab, you can maintain a list of your transactions, adding, editing, deleting and filtering items
as you like. The image below gives an overview of the GUI of the feature:

[[transactionsScreenshot]]
.Transaction tab
image::TransactionsScreenshot.png[]

Before we introduce the commands you can use, let us briefly run through the labelled components of our GUI.

===== Transaction list / cell
The transaction list comprises several transaction cells. Each transaction cell represents a single transaction.
We give a further breakdown of the information each transaction cell displays in the following image:

[[transactionCell]]
.Information in a transaction cell
image::TransactionCell.png[]

[NOTE]
We differentiate income items from expenditure items using the color of the text for the "Amount" field. A green
amount indicates that the transaction is an income item; a red amount indicates that the transaction is an
expenditure item. For example, the first transaction cell in <<transactionsScreenshot>> represents an income item,
whereas the second cell represents an expenditure item.


===== Filter title
The filter title indicates which transactions are being shown. In <<transactionsScreenshot>>, the list
shows only transactions that occur on October 2019, under the category "Food".

Minimally, the filter title contains the month and year of the filter applied. It can also display
the category shown, as well as whether only expenditure/income items are shown.

The filter title changes along with the filter that is applied to the list. You can change the filter using
the `filtertx` command in <<filtertx>>

[NOTE]
On startup, the filter is generated based on the latest transaction you have recorded,
up to the current date. The filter follows the month and year of this transaction, and does not
filter for category or type.
If there are no transactions recorded, the current date in the system is used to
generate the the filter.
This makes it easier for you to access the transactions in the current month!

// tag::filtertx[]
[[filtertx]]
==== Filtering transactions: `filtertx`
Format: `filtertx [m/MONTH] [y/YEAR] [c/CATEGORY] [ty/TYPE]`

Let's say you are currently viewing transactions from September 2018. The GUI of Ichifund may look like this:

image::filtertx1.png[]

Suppose you want to view transactions from a different month, say, September 2018.
You can simply enter the command `filtertx m/9 y/2018`, which results in the following view:

image::filtertx2.png[]


Now, if you want to only see expenditure items, simply enter the command `filtertx ty/exp`.

image::filtertx3.png[]

You may find that this view of the list is still too cluttered for you. In that case,
you can further limit the transactions in the list to contain only items from the category "FOOD" using
the command `filtertx c/food`

image::filtertx4.png[]

If you want to see expenditure items of the same time, but in a different month, say, August 2019, enter
the command `filtertx m/8`. Note that you do not need to enter the year, category, or transaction type again.
The GUI will update accordingly, as follows:

image::filtertx5.png[]

[NOTE]
To see only expenditure items, enter `filtertx ty/exp`; to see only income items, enter `filtertx ty/in`. This
also applies when you are adding transactions in <<addtx>>

===== Removing category and transaction type filter
Now, if you want to remove both the category filter and the transaction type, you can enter the command
`filtertx c/!all ty/!all`.

image::filtertx6.png[]

[NOTE]
You can only remove the category and transaction type filter using the `!all` argument. We do not support
the removal of the month and year filter.

[TIP]
Like the other commands in IchiFund, you can enter the arguments in any order, as long as
the command word `filtertx` is keyed in at the start.

// end::filtertx[]

[[addtx]]
==== Creating transaction: `addtx`
Format: `addtx de/DESCRIPTION a/AMOUNT [c/CATEGORY] [d/DAY] [m/MONTH] [y/YEAR] [ty/TRANSACTION_TYPE]`

Imagine you are browsing your transactions under the category of "Transportation" in November.
Your GUI may look like this:

image::addtx1.png[]

Let's say you remember that spent $12.31 on lunch on 31 October 2019.
If you want to record this transaction under the category "FOOD", you can enter the full
command `addtx de/Lunch a/12.31 c/food d/31 m/10 y/2019 ty/exp`

The application now looks like this:

image::addtx2.png[]

Here, IchiFund automatically changes the filter for you, so that you can review the addition
you made. This makes it convenient if you want to edit your transactions, as detailed in <<edittx>>

Also, note that the transaction appears at the top of the list. This is because we automatically sort
your transactions by date, followed by category, so that you can systematically look through your
transactions.

[NOTE]
When specifying whether a transaction is an expenditure item or an income item, use the arguments
`ty/exp` or `ty/in` respectively, similar to how would do so in <<filtertx>>

===== Optional arguments

You may find the command used earlier too cumbersome to type. If so, you can leave out some of the optional
arguments. To illustrate this, let's return to the earlier scenario:

image::addtx1.png[]

Let's say it is 1 November 2019 today. You have just spent another $10.00 hiring a cab to go to the hospital,
and want to record this transaction under the category of "Transportation". You can simply enter
the command `addtx a/10 de/Cab to hospital`, and obtain the following result:

image::addtx3.png[]

Here, as the month, year, and category arguments are left empty, IchiFund fills it in according to the
filter title. The day argument is taken to be the current day of the month, according to the system date.
IchiFund also assumes that most transactions are expenditure items, and uses that as a default value.

The following table summarizes the default values that optional arguments take if left unspecified.

|==============================
| Argument | Default values

| Day | According to system time and date.
| Month | According to the filter
| Year | According to the filter
| Category | According to the filter, if applicable, or "Uncategorised" otherwise.
| Type | According to the filter, if applicable, or "exp" otherwise.
|==============================

[TIP]
The default value of the day argument is the current day of month in the system time. Hence, to utilise this
feature to its fullest, you are recommended to add transactions on the day it occurs.

===== Constraints
The feature for adding transactions is built to work best under these constraints:

|==============================
| Argument | Constraints

| Description | Up to 50 alphanumeric characters, case-sensitive
| Amount | Positive number, with up to 2 decimal places; maximum value of $100000 for each transaction
| Category | Up to 50 alphanumeric characters, case-insensitive
| Day | Numerical value from 1-31
| Month | Numerical value from 1-12
| Year | Numerical value from 2000-9999
| Type | Either "in" or "exp"
