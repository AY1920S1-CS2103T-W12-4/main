== Introduction

IchiFund is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing finance*. More importantly, IchiFund is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, IchiFund can get your finance management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!
