== Introduction

IchiFund is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing finance*. More importantly, IchiFund is
*optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a
Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, IchiFund can get your finance management tasks done faster than
traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `ichifund.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your IchiFund.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window. +
Here are some example commands you can try in the transaction tab:

* **`addtx`**`de/Lunch a/12.30` : adds an expenditure item for "Lunch" to IchiFund.
* **`filtertx`**`m/10 y/2019 c/!all ty/exp` : finds all expenditure items from October 2019.
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Navigation>> for details on how to navigate through the application.
.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

[[Navigation]]
== Navigation
IchiFund has five features: Transactions, Repeaters, Budgets, Loans and Analytics.
Each feature is allocated to its own tab, and the commands for each feature only work when you are
using the tab associated to the feature.

When you enter a command that is not used by the feature, the following message is shown:

image::InapplicableCommand.png[]

In this case, `expenditure`, a command for the "Analytics", is not recognised as the application is currently
is the "Transactions" tab.

=== Switching tabs

We offer three modes for you to switch tabs:

. Clicking on the tab
. Using a shortcut key
. Entering a global command

The global commands and shortcut keys are summarized in the table below:

|==============================
| Feature | Command | Shortcut Key

| Transactions | `tx` | `Ctrl + 1`
| Repeaters | `rep` | `Ctrl + 2`
| Budgets | `budget` | `Ctrl + 3`
| Loans | `loan` | `Ctrl + 4`
| Analytics | `analytics` | `Ctrl + 5`
|==============================

To use the global command, simply enter the command as you would for any other
command, and the application automatically switches to the appropriate tab.
These commands are recognised regardless of which tab you are currently using.

Before we introduce the commands you can use, let us briefly run through the labelled components of our GUI.

===== Transaction list / cell
The transaction list comprises several transaction cells. Each transaction cell represents a single transaction.
We give a further breakdown of the information each transaction cell displays in the following image:

[[transactionCell]]
.Information in a transaction cell
image::TransactionCell.png[]

[NOTE]
We differentiate income items from expenditure items using the color of the text for the "Amount" field. A green
amount indicates that the transaction is an income item; a red amount indicates that the transaction is an
expenditure item. For example, the first transaction cell in <<transactionsScreenshot>> represents an income item,
whereas the second cell represents an expenditure item.


===== Filter title
The filter title indicates which transactions are being shown. In <<transactionsScreenshot>>, the list
shows only transactions that occur on October 2019, under the category "Food".

The filter title changes along with the filter that is applied to the list. You can change the filter using
the `filtertx` command in <<filtertx>>

Minimally, the filter title contains the month and year of the filter applied. It can also display
the category shown, as well as whether only expenditure/income items are shown.
